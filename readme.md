## Bento Javascript Game Engine

Bento is a modular, component based Javascript game engine. 

## Installation

Install Node.js and use `npm install`. To build the engine, use the `gulp` command. If you don't want to build you can also just get bento.js from the build folder and include this in your game.

## How to use

(Not written yet...)
Easiest way to get started for now is to copy the Empty Bento project: https://bitbucket.org/luckykat/empty-bento-project

Remembering parameters and module names is a drag. These Sublime Text snippets will make your life easier: [snippets](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/luckykat/xREop)
