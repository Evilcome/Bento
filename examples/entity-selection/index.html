Finding other entities during gameplay is an important feature which is handled by the Bento Object Manager (Bento.objects). There are 3 methods:
<br>
<br>
* Bento.objects.get (green)<br>
Gets the first object it can find with a certain name. Returns null and doesn't call the callback if nothing found.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Bento.objects.getByName (blue)<br>
Computationally the heaviest of all. If you need a group of entities, it's recommended to use families.<br>
<br>
<br>
* Bento.objects.getByFamily (red)<br>
Bento Object Manager caches all entities of a family in an array. This provides a relatively quick method to retrieve a group of entities. You can make an entity a family member of multiple families by passing an array in the constructor.<br>
Note: entity.family is inspected by the object manager the moment you use Bento.objects.attach(). Editing the entity.family array after it has been attached will do nothing.
<br>
<br>
The get methods are computationally quite heavy, so try to cache your results if you need a reference to an existing entity instead of using Bento.objects.get every frame.
